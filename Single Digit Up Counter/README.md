# Single Digit Up Counter


You might have seen a timer on a websites or atleast on your phone. 
 we are also going to create a wonderful timer ourselves.
 The Counter starts from zero and ends at some number which the user enters in the input. The ipput only takes a number.
 We will create a small counter , for now, that can only go from one to nine. Handle all possible cases when the "start Counter"  button can be clicked.
